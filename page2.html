        <p class="description-1">A twist on the traditional meatloaf. A cross between meatloaf and meatballs. 
            <br>Ground beef, onion, ritz crackers, eggs, milk, salt, and pepper.</p>
        <p class="recipe">2 lbs. ground beef
            <br>1 onion, diced
            <br>1 sleeve of Ritz Crackers
            <br>2 eggs
            <br>1/4 cup milk, if it seems dry
            <br>Salt and pepper
            <br>
            <br>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 
            <br>Spray cooking spray into muffin tin. Smash crackers with your fingers and place in a large bowl. 
            <br>Add other ingredients, except for meat and milk. Use fork to mix together.
            <br>Add meat and work through with your fingers. You may add milk if it seems too dry. (I never have) 
            <br>Form meatloaf mixture into balls about the right size for the muffin tin.
            <br>Cook muffin tin over a cookie sheet to catch grease that overflows. Cook for about 30 minutes or until it reaches 165. 
            <br> Use thermometer to ensure the center of the center meatloaf is 165 degrees.
            <br>To add more flavor you could add ketchup </p>
